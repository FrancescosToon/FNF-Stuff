# Francesco's Toon FNF Stuff
All of my Friday Night Funkin' material will be available here, such as Chromatics, Samples, FLPs, midis, etc...
You're free to use them for your own covers/remixes but please credit the original source (In this case me)

# NOTICE:
Some FLPs will be uploaded to a google drive if their file size is bigger than 25 MB, so keep an eye out in the video descriptions as that's where the lik most likely will be.

I will update this page as time goes on, by adding more material!
